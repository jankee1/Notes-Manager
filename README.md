# Notes-Manager

Please note, that this project is not finished yet -> it lacks of front-end layer.

Main goal of this project was to create application that allows me to practice SQL along with PHP programming skills.  Except from making my first fully working application with usage of these two languages my intention was also make this code understandable and easy to maintain, hence I tried to implement MVC design pattern

Topics covered:
-	OOP
-	MVC
-	CRUD
-	Login and registration forms
-	Sessions
-	PDO
-	Usage of relational database

After uploading:
1. Import 'notes_manager.sql' file in phpMyAdmin panel (this file contains all necessary tables and columns which are required for this application to work properly).
2. Copy 'notes_manager' folder directly to 'htdocs' folder (if you want to copy it to specific subfolder, make sure to update line 4 in '.htacces' file in 'public' folder and line 2 in 'config.php' file in 'app' folder).
3. You can create your own account or use test account that is already created (login: 'test123', password: '123').
4. All data necessery for connection to database are included in 'config.php' file.

Technologies used:
* HTML 5
* PHP 7.4.3
* SQL
